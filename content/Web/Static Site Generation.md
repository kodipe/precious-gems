# Static Site Generation

As a writting from scratch enthusiast I'd like to work on own simple static site generator. There is couple of things which needs to be considered:

- Content markup and way of storage  
  I would go with simple Markdown files in repository. For now I don't want to sync with external tools. Will see.
- Language and toolset  
  For now I would prefer to not use any framework or library. Let's try to do it the simplest way with some scripts and github workflows.
- Design  
  Similar thing - ready to use tools may not be the most interesting part of the process so I would try to do it in classic CSS with some modern APIs.
