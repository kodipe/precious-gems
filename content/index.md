# Precious Gems

Welcome to my digital garden. I'm going to keep here all of my thoughts about software engineering and other computer science related stuff.

For now, it's a simple website hosted on GitHub pages and based on markdown files from my repository. 

I'm challenging myself to handle everything on my own, so all content generation is done by scripts written in `bash`. It's really fun to learn bash and do my own website at the same time. There are still some things to do like markdown parsing etc., but for now I'm pretty glad about results after two days of coding.
