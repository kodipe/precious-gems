# Precious Gems

Welcome to my digital garden. I'm going to keep here all of my thoughts about software engineering and other computer science related stuff.

For now, it's a simple website hosted on GitHub pages and based on markdown files from my repository. In next days I will do some research about sync between GitHub and some note-taking apps.

Stay tuned!
